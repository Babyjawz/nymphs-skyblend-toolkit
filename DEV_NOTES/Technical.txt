📦 Skyrim Material Patcher – Current Feature Summary (v1.9.8)
🧱 Overview

Skyrim Material Patcher (SMP) is a Blender 4.5 add-on that rebuilds and manages materials for imported Skyrim NIF meshes.
It’s designed to work directly with PyNifly, reconstructing shader nodes automatically and applying texture, emissive, and alpha data from imported assets.

The add-on provides two build modes:

PBR (Physically-Based Rendering) – for materials using _rmaos or _orm texture sets.

Vanilla (Classic Skyrim Shader) – for older non-PBR materials.

Each material is given a custom skpbr property group to store per-material settings such as emissive color, strength, and force-build overrides.

🧩 Core Systems
🧠 Mode Detection

_detect_pbr(textures) determines whether to build a PBR or vanilla layout.

Detection is based on texture filename patterns (_rmaos.dds, _orm.dds, _metal.dds, etc.).

The user can override this with the Force Build (PBR) checkbox in the material panel.

🪜 Build Anchors

_remember_mode_anchor() and _choose_anchor_for_mode() record texture search anchors based on:

The original NIF import path.

The texture directory structure.

Manual override if provided.

This system lets SMP rebuild materials even when textures are moved or located externally.

Every rebuild logs the selected anchor mode (NIFPATH, SIBLING, or MANUAL).

🎨 Node Construction
🧩 PBR Node Build

Builds a complete Principled BSDF material setup using:

Base Color

Normal Map

Roughness / Metallic (from _rmaos or _orm textures)

Displacement (optional)

Adds an emissive chain:
